Hi everybody
Today we will start from scracth a new gutenberb block
or to be more precise
we will get the help of some helpfull tools to build up a block in less than 5 minutes

first
open you console
move on your projects folder

cd /c/Projects
and run this command
npx @wordpress/create-block --wp-env
A prompt guide will ask you some infos about you blcok
static: is a block where the content of your block doesn't change at the saving time of the post
dinamic is one that change after the save of your post

I will choose static
the slug for me will be wp-test
